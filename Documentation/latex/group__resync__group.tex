Local interconnect network (L\+I\+N) is widely used standard for low cost automotive networks. 

In order to ensure reliable communication via L\+I\+N bus, a bus clock of M\+C\+U needs to be accurate enough to avoid errors. M\+C\+U can use crystal or ceramic resonator to provide very accurate bus clocks. However, L\+I\+N protocol was designed to allow more cost-\/effective solution. An automatic resynchronization feature allows more cost-\/effective solution\+: M\+C\+Us can use on-\/chip oscillators to implement L\+I\+N slaves, even though the on-\/chip oscillators have less accuracy than a crystal. The automatic resynchronization module use the L\+I\+N S\+Y\+N\+C field which is composed of five falling edges to synchronize with the master baud rate. The module measures the sync byte field and adjusts the slave bus frequency after each L\+I\+N sync field reception from the master node.
