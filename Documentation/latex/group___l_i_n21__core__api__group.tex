L\+I\+N 2.\+1 is extended from in L\+I\+N 2.\+0 specification through diagnostic services and few functions were removed as obsolete.  


L\+I\+N 2.\+1 is extended from in L\+I\+N 2.\+0 specification through diagnostic services and few functions were removed as obsolete. 


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item L\+I\+N 2.\+1 is compatible with L\+I\+N 2.\+0\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A L\+I\+N 2.\+1 master node may handle a L\+I\+N 2.\+0 slave node if the master node also contains all functionality of a L\+I\+N 2.\+0 master node, e.\+g. obsolete functions like Assign frame Id. 


\item A L\+I\+N 2.\+1 slave node can be used in a cluster with a L\+I\+N 2.\+0 master node if the L\+I\+N 2.\+1 slave node is pre-\/configured, i.\+e. the L\+I\+N 2.\+1 slave node has a valid configuration after reset. 
\end{DoxyItemize}


\item Changes between L\+I\+N 2.\+0 and L\+I\+N 2.\+1

L\+I\+N2.\+1 enhance the capacity of L\+I\+N2.\+0 on event-\/triggered frame collision handling and diagnostic services supported. Besides, several features are add to fulfill powerful capacity of L\+I\+N network such as configuration service, assign frame I\+D range configuration, etc.
