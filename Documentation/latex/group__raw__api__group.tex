The raw A\+P\+I is operating on P\+D\+U level and it is typically used to gateway P\+D\+Us between C\+A\+N and L\+I\+N.  


The raw A\+P\+I is operating on P\+D\+U level and it is typically used to gateway P\+D\+Us between C\+A\+N and L\+I\+N. 

Usually, a F\+I\+F\+O is used to buffer P\+D\+Us in order to handle the different bus speeds.
