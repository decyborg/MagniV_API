Low level layer consists of core functions for the L\+I\+N protocol.  


Low level layer consists of core functions for the L\+I\+N protocol. 

This layer contains the implementation of L\+I\+N protocol such as the frames handling, signals transmission and reception, data preparation, etc. Besides, this layer contains common implementation functions for the lowest layer to provide the interface abstraction. Function for L\+I\+N cluster setup can be found here as well. This layer interacts with the core A\+P\+I layer through low level A\+P\+I functions.
