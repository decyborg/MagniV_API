A\+U\+T\+O\+B\+A\+U\+D is an extensive feature in L\+I\+N Driver which allows a peripheral M\+C\+U to detect baud rate of L\+I\+N bus and adapt its original baud rate to bus value.  


A\+U\+T\+O\+B\+A\+U\+D is an extensive feature in L\+I\+N Driver which allows a peripheral M\+C\+U to detect baud rate of L\+I\+N bus and adapt its original baud rate to bus value. 

Auto Baud is applied when the baud rate of the incoming data is unknown or the baud rate is fixed with some specific values. Each L\+I\+N network might have different configuration on such baudrates. One M\+C\+U can work with different configurations without flashing.
