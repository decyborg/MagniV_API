J2602 protocol is L\+I\+N 2.\+0 based.  


J2602 protocol is L\+I\+N 2.\+0 based. 

It contains L\+I\+N 2.\+0\textquotesingle{}s modules to support Signal management, network management, scheduler and J2602 status management. The goal of J2602 is to improve the interoperability and interchangeability of L\+I\+N devices within a network by resolving those L\+I\+N2.\+0 requirements that are ambiguous, conflicting, or optional. Moreover, J2602 provides additional requirements that are not present in L\+I\+N2.\+0. For example\+: fault tolerant, operation, network topology, etc. Different to L\+I\+N2.\+1 protocol, J2602 does not support sporadic and event trigger frames in communication.
