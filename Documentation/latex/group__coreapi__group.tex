\subsection{Detailed Description}
Refer to chappter 7, L\+I\+N 2.\+1 specification. 


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Core A\+P\+I layer consists of A\+P\+I functions as defined by the L\+I\+N2.\+1/\+J2602 specification
\item Enabling the user to utilize the L\+I\+N2.\+1/\+J2602 communication within the user application.
\item Both the static and dynamic modes for calling the A\+P\+I functions are supported.
\item The core A\+P\+I layer interacts with the low level layer and can be called by such upper layers as L\+I\+N2.\+1 T\+L A\+P\+I, L\+I\+N T\+L J2602 or application for diagnostic implementation
